  <h1>Privacy Policy for Pingu Chrome Extension</h1>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personally identifiable information:</strong> such as your email address and, if provided, your name.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication information:</strong> such as authentication tokens (e.g., Supabase token) to identify and authorize you.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal communications:</strong> the content of emails you generate and send using the extension.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial and payment information:</strong> We do not collect or store any payment or credit card information. All payments are processed securely by Stripe, and we only store a Stripe customer ID and subscription status.</li>
    <li><strong>Website Content</strong>We do not collect or store any content on any website you are visiting while on extension. We just take the current URL you are on ONLY when you click the "Add URL" button.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you and provide access to your account.</li>
    <li>To generate, store, and send personalized outreach emails on your behalf.</li>
    <li>To save your preferences and form data for a seamless user experience.</li>
    <li>To manage your subscription status and credits (via Stripe and Supabase).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>Your data may be shared with:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> for secure storage of your profile, settings, and credits.</li>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> for payment processing and subscription management (only your email and Stripe customer ID are shared; payment details are never stored by us).</li>
        <li><strong>Gmail API:</strong> if you use the “Send with Gmail” feature, your email content is sent via Google’s Gmail API to deliver your message. Extension requires access to Googles' "tabs" permissions, which are ONLY used to connect with your Gmail writing and send emails. This extension does not access any other tabs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data, including secure HTTPS connections, authentication tokens, and trusted third-party services (Supabase, Stripe, Google).</p>
